## Online Doctor Reservation System -Mediclinic (2021)

Mediclinic is a mobile application created for both patients and doctors to
work with ease. No need for physical meet-ups with doctors. So that doctors
and patient can share their health issues through this app. Join clinics, and
add notes and notices, are the main benefits you can gain from this app.

In this project, I am responsible for the implementation of the doctor and patient profile management system.
This system provides a convenient solution for both doctors and patients to identify and access their respective profiles with ease.
Doctors and patients can create their profiles by inputting relevant personal details, and the profiles are displayed on separate pages.
The profile information can be edited or deleted as needed, ensuring the accuracy and up-to-date nature of the profiles.
